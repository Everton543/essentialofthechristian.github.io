But I recommend a simpler approach that is written on Luke 12, it’s better to read the whole chapter, but I’ll put here the most important parts: \n\n \" 13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. \n\n 14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? \n\n 15 And he said unto them, take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. \n\n 16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: \n\n 17 And he thought within himself, saying, what shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? \n\n 18 And he said, this will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. \n\n 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, beat, drink, and be merry. \n\n 20 But God said unto him, thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? \n\n 21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. \n\n 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. \" \n\n The versicle 34 is the summary of this teaching, if your only objective in life is to only speak and worry about being rich, then you only treasure wealth and your heart will be only your money. But if you worry about being a good Christian and do your best to keep the commandments every day, then your heart will be in the kingdom of heaven. \n\n Those that have the heart for the kingdom of heaven, share with others their wealth, give opportunities for others to also be able to sustain their family, they don’t try to keep everything for their own gain. And a perfect example of this is the book of Job. \n\n Job was a man considered perfect and upright, but he was also a man with great wealth, but his heart was with God, so much that even when he lost everything, he continues to keep the commandments, and was blessed with even more wealth. If being wealth was a sin, then Job would be one of the greatest sinners in the Bible.",
