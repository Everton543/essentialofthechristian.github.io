Every time someone tried to teach me about Christ I would always listen because of education. \n Still, one day when I was listening to two young men teaching about the gospel of Jesus Christ  I had the Spirit make me remember the teachings on the parable that made me an essential question \n \"What kind of soil do you want to be?\". \n  From that day on, I started to live my life with these questions in my mind, before each decision I would ask myself, what kind of soil does this show that I am? \n\n This website is for all Christians, and I would like each of you to share here what changed in your life after practicing the teachings of the Parable of the Sower.",
